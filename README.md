# Hey everyone!

Welcome to my little corner of the internet, where you can get to know more about my work and what I do! All of this can be found at **[https://www.griel.dev.br](https://www.griel.dev.br/)** - so, don't miss the chance to take a look!

But I didn't just want to show the site to you, I wanted to share a bit about what was done to create it. I did all of this using React with NextJS, and stored everything in a MongoDB database. I put a lot of effort into following the best programming practices, so that the site is fast, secure, and easy to use.

And the best part? I created all of this with a lot of love! I'm always looking for ways to improve the site, whether it be adding new features, fixing bugs, or just making the user experience even more pleasant.

So, don't hesitate to take a look at my personal site. I hope you like it as much as I loved creating it!
